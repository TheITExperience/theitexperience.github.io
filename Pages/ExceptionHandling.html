            <h4>What is Exception Handling</h4>
            <p>Exception handling involves dealing with errors that occur
                while the program is executing. An exception is a signal generated when an abnormal event has occurred in a running program. It is used to manage situations which are outside the normal flow of program execution. Separates error-handling code from normal
                processing code. Exceptions alter the flow of execution in a program from normal processing to executing an exception. Exception handling allows errors to be trapped and an
                appropriate message displayed to the user informing
                that an error has occurred. Exception Handling uses exceptions to indicate or signal that an error
                has occurred. Exceptions are separate from the return values of methods. Exceptions can be logged so that the developer can use the log to debug the program at a later date. When an error occurs, an exception is produced. This is called raising or throwing the exception. The block of code where exceptions can be thrown is called the try block. The block of code to handle the exceptions generated is known as the catch handler (or catch block). The point in the code where the exception is generated is known as the throw point
                 </p><br>

                 <h4>The Benefits of Exception Handling</h4><br>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Separates error handling code from regular code by handling the exception in a catch handler</li>
                    <li>If possible, allows program to run normally after
                        exception has occurred</li>
                    <li>If this is not possible, allows a graceful shutdown of
                        the program instead of an abrupt termination</li>
                    <li>Sufficiently handle unexpected occurrences and errors the programmer might not anticipate</li>
                    <li>Improves the robustness of the program</li>
                    <li>Improves the reliability of the programme</li>
                    <li>provides defensive programming capabilities</li>
                 </ul><br>

                 <h4>Exception Handling Models</h4><br>

                 
                    <p style=" text-transform: uppercase;">Resumption model</p>

                 <p>In the resumption model of exception handling,
                    statement execution resumes with the line
                    following the one that raised the exception. This model is used in languages such as BASIC</p><br>


                    <p style=" text-transform: uppercase;">Termination model</p>

                    <p>In the termination model of exception handling, the
                        block of code containing the line that raised the
                        exception is immediately terminated and control is
                        passed to the exception handler in the method if
                        one is present, otherwise the method immediately
                        terminates. This model is used in C++ and Java programming languages</p><br>


                    
                 <h4>Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions</h4><br>   

                 <p style=" text-transform: uppercase;">Unchecked Exceptions</p>
                 <p>These are exceptions that a program is not required
                    to handle. The program will compile successfully even
                    if no exception handler is present. All exceptions in C++ are unchecked, but only exceptions that inherit from RuntimeException in Java
                    are unchecked.</p><br>
                    

                    <p style=" text-transform: uppercase;">Checked Exceptions</p>
                    <p>These are exceptions that a program must handle.
                        The program will not compile if no exception handler
                        is present or if the exception is not declared (so it can
                        be propagated forward).‚óèAll exceptions that inherit from class Exception in Java are checked exceptions (apart from those that inherit
                        from class RuntimeException). All checked exceptions
                        in Java must be handled or declared. </p><br>


                <h4>Unhandled Exceptions</h4><br>   
                <p>If	an	unchecked	exception	is	raised	or	thrown	but	
                    there	is	no	catch	handler	for	that exception. The	exception	is	propagated	upward	until	an	
                    appropriate	catch	handler	is	found	or	the	program	
                    terminates. This	process	is	called	stack	unwinding. However,	if	an	appropriate	catch	handler	is	found	
                    then	the	exception	is	considered	handled	and	stack	
                    unwinding	stops. Example: If main() called A() and A() called B() and an
                    unhandled exception is thrown in B(),
                    B() will terminate and return to A(),
                    If the exception is not handled in A(), A() will
                    terminate and return to main()
                    If the exception is still not handled in main(), main()
                    too will terminate and the entire program will
                    terminate abnormally </p><br>


                    <h4>Exception Hierarchy</h4><br> 
                    <p>Both C++ and Java have exception hierarchies in which
                        various exception classes are sub classes of some base
                        exception or error class.
                        Objects of the child class exceptions are also
                        considered exceptions of their respective parent
                        classes.
                        For instance, you could code a catch handler to catch
                        exception objects in C++ or Exception objects in Java,
                        and this would catch all exceptions of the type of the
                        parent as well as those of type of the child classes</p>  <br>


                    <h4>Explicitly	Throwing	Exceptions</h4><br> 
                    <p>In	C++,	exceptions	have	to	be	explicitly	thrown	by	the	
                        programmer	in	code.
                        Java	allows	the	programmer	to	explicitly	throw	
                        exceptions,	but	it	can	also	automatically	throw	some	
                        exceptions,	for	example,	a	division	by	zero	at	runtime	
                        causes	Java	to	automatically	throw	an	
                        ArithmeticException. In	Java	only	exception	objects	can	be	thrown,	while	in	
                        C++	any	data	type,	value	or	object	can	be	thrown
                        In	both	languages,	the	keyword	to	throw	an	exception	
                        is	throw. </p><br>


                    <h4>Re-throwing Exceptions</h4><br> 
                    <p>Once an exception is processed by a catch block it is
                        considered as being handled.
                        What if the method containing the catch handler
                        wants to propagate the exception up through the call
                        stack? Re-throwing an exception allows a method to send a
                        just-handled exception up to a calling method to
                        indicate that the exception occurred.
                        For example, if main() calls A() and A() calls B(), and
                        B() handles an exception, it can rethrow that exception
                        so it A() too can handle it, and A() in turn can rethrow
                        it to main() for processing there. Re-throwing an exception is done inside the catch
                        block / catch handler<br>
                        Keyword format for C++:
                        throw;
                        (note that in C++ the throw statement is by itself to
                        indicate a re-thrown exception).<br>
                        Keyword format Java:
                        throw ex;
                        (where ex is the exception object caught)</p><br>


                        <h4>Exception Specifiers/Declaration</h4><br> 
                        <p>State that a method can throw a specific exception or
                            set of exceptions
                            Exceptions that can be thrown are specified after the
                            argument list but before the method body using the
                            keywords throw in C++ or throws in Java
                            C++:
                            
                            void method( ) throw (int, string) { }. Java:

                            void method( ) throws SQLException,
                            
                            IOException { }
                            C++ and Java differ on how exception specifiers are
                            treated by the language compilers
                            Become part of the signature of the method in C++
                            but not in Java</p><br>

                        <h4>Java's Finally Block</h4><br>

                        <p>Because both C++ and Java use the termination model
                            of exception handling it is possible that some code will
                            not get executed when an exception is thrown
                            For instance, a file or database may have been
                            opened or memory allocated, then the exception
                            occurs and is handled before the code to close the
                            file/database or release the memory was executed. This causes resource leaks

                            Java tries to correct this by providing a finally block
                            which always gets executed whether or not an
                            exception is thrown. (except when System.exit() is
                            used).
                            C++ does not have a corresponding finally block. <br><br>
                            Note:
                            In C++ every try block must be
                            followed by at least one catch
                            block.
                            
                            In Java the catch block is
                            optional if there is a finally
                            block.
                            
                            Also in Java, the finally block is
                            optional if there is a catch block
                            however there must be one or
                            the other or else the Java
                            compiler will generate an error.

                            The¬†finally block¬†is helpful for more than simply managing exceptions; it enables the programmer to prevent having to write¬†cleanup code from unintentionally being skipped by a return, continue, or break commands. Even when no exceptions are predicted, it is always a good idea to place cleaning code in a finally.
                        </p><br>

                        <h4>Problems with Exception Handling</h4><br>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Exception handling can lead to surprisingly irregular
                                execution of code</li>
                            <li>Exception handling can hide underlying errors by
                                trapping the exceptions thrown but not sufficiency
                                distilling or handling the error that caused the
                                exception</li>
                            <li>Exception handling can cause resource leaks a
                                resource is acquired and used by a method but an
                                exception occurs before the resource is released</li>
